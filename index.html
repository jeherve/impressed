	<div class="fallback-message">
	    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
	    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>

	<div id="impress">
	
	    <!--
	        
	        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.
	        
	        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
	        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
	        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
	        
	        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
	        
	        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
	        and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
	        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
	        
	        It will not be rotated or scaled.
	        
	    -->
	    <div id="intro" class="step slide" data-x="-1000" data-y="-1500">
	        <q>Aren't you just <b>bored</b> with all those slides-based presentations?</q>
	    </div>

	    <div id="today" class="step slide" data-x="0" data-y="-1500">
	        <q>Don't you think that presentations given <strong>in modern browsers</strong> shouldn't <strong>copy the limits</strong> of 'classic' slide decks?</q>
	    </div>
	
	    <div id="options" class="step slide" data-x="1000" data-y="-1500">
	        <q>Would you like to <strong>impress your audience</strong> with <strong>stunning visualization</strong> of your talk?</q>
	    </div>
	
	    <!--
	        
	        This is an example of step element being scaled.
	        
	        Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
	        element will be 4 times larger than the others.
	        From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
	        down (4 times) to make it back to it's correct size.
	        
	    -->
	    <div id="title" class="step" data-x="0" data-y="0" data-scale="4">
	        <span class="try">then you should try</span>
	        <h1>impress.js<sup>*</sup></h1>
	        <span class="footnote"><sup>*</sup> no rhyme intended</span>
	    </div>
	
	    <!--
	        
	        This element introduces rotation.
	        
	        Notation shouldn't be a surprise. We use `data-rotate="90"` attribute, meaning that this
	        element should be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.
	        
	    -->
	    <div id="its" class="step" data-x="850" data-y="3000" data-rotate="90" data-scale="5">
	        <p>It's a <strong>presentation tool</strong> <br/>
	        inspired by the idea behind <a href="http://prezi.com">prezi.com</a> <br/>
	        and based on the <strong>power of CSS3 transforms and transitions</strong> in modern browsers.</p>

	    <div id="big" class="step" data-x="3500" data-y="2100" data-rotate="180" data-scale="6">

	    </div>
	
	    <!--
	        
	        And now it gets really exiting! We move into third dimension!
	        
	        Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
	        `data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
	        positioned far away from us (by 3000px).
	        
	    -->
	    <div id="tiny" class="step" data-x="2825" data-y="2325" data-z="-3000" data-rotate="300" data-scale="1">
	        <p>and <b>tiny</b> ideas</p>
	    </div>
	
	    <!--
	        
	        This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
	        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
	        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
	        reached.
	        
	        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
	        It means that they haven't been visited yet.
	        
	        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
	        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.
	        
	        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
	        class is added.
	        
	        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
	        Only one current step has the `present` class.
